#VTJoinMe

This app is designed to allow VT students to more effectively use the space on
campus by creating pins which represent tables. These pins show how many seats
are available as well as other features.

Setup & Install
This folder will be recognized by Android Studio (3.5 or newer) as an Android
project. Opening it will give the familiar layout. A Firebase project connected
to Google Cloud Platform must be created, as the pins users create are stored
in Firebase and the Maps SDK requires Google Cloud Platform. The new Firebase
project should have authentication through email enabled, as well as Cloud
Firestore. The google-services.json should be changed to the file generated when
creating a new Firebase project. The API key in AndroidManifest.xml should be
changed to the appropriate new Maps SDK key for the app to function.
